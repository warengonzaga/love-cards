## 💡 Inspiration

All credits goes to this [codepen](https://codepen.io/noirsociety/pen/ZEwLGXB). It gives me an idea to create this opensource project. I modified some part of it's code and add some features to make it more customizable and easy to use.

## 🔨 Build Steps

> [!NOTE]  
> This project has limitations as of now. We can only have exact 6 love cards. That means you have to fill out each with information such as title, message, and images. I will update this project to have a dynamic love cards experience in the future.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies.
3. Edit the `data.json` file to customize the love cards title and contents.
4. Repalce the images in the `src/assets/img` folder with your own images.
5. Run `yarn start` to start the local server.
